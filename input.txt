Hi, my name is Matt. I'm a 24 year old who is looking for a place to live in the next few months. I'm a pretty chill guy who likes to play video games, watch movies, and go out to eat. I'm also a pretty clean person and I'm always down to help out around the house. I'm looking for a place that is around $500 a month and I'm looking to move in around the end of July. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks!
